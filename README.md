# How to upload code
1. Clone the repo onto your computer with: git clone https://github.com/RDerrow/COMP3500_Project4
This is where all of the code for the project will reside. If you want to just make a copy of cs161 folder and place it into the repo folder (COMP3500_Project4) doing this everytime you make changes. Another option is to just put the entire cs161 folder into the COMP3500_Project4 folder  and cd into the COMP3500_Project4 folder to edit the code.

2. Any time you want add code to the staging area cd into the COMP3500_Project4 and type this command into your terminal: git add .

3. When you want to commit your code that you just added to the staging area enter this command into the terminal: git commit -m "(your message for the committed code)"

4. When you finally want to push the code to the repo enter this command into your terminal: git push origin master
